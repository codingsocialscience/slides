# Chapter 7
# Interactive systems

---

# Learning goals

- Describe what an interactive system is
- Outline how interactive systems can be used for experimental research
- Identify the new opportunities that interactive systems provide for experimental studies
- Describe how an interactive system is designed
- Investigate social science concepts in terms of design-based approaches

# Interactive systems

* Humans can interact with computers
* Interactive systems are developed using programming languages and often have a graphical user interface
* Interactive systems in this book
  * Research apparatus: experimental studies
  * Object of research: constructive research

---

# Prototypes

Prototypes are simple manifestations that demonstrate ideas.
They alllow testing interactive system ideas before they are developed into full-fledged interactive systems, in order of fidelity:

* Scenarios and fiction
* Storyboards and comic strips
* Mock-ups and sketches
* Wizard of Oz
* Functional prototypes

---

# Experiments online and in the lab

Experiments allow developing stronger claims than that can be tested through observational studies alone. They usually allow researchers to control what people see and can do.

* Extended samples: Online services, survey experiments
* Extended control and reality:Virtual reality, robots

---

# Experiments online and in the lab

* Interactive systems can be collaborative, enabling group-based experiments or designs which have social interaction.
* Opportunities to fake social interaction.
* Online experiments can be in-the-wild, take place in peoples living experiences, not only within the boundaries of laboratory settings.
* Better access to participants via crowdsourcing platforms, which allow larger sample sizes but may produce additional challenges as well.

---

### Learning activity

* Pair or group discussion: Exercise 7.1
* Class discussion: Exercise 7.2
* Class discussion: Exercise 7.3

---

# Interactive systems’ design as a social science method

* Design is an activity where different ways of solving a problem are explored.
* Design narrows down a wider design space to some set of ideas to experiment on.
* Often design is future oriented, which is not a traditional social science approach.

# Design as a practice

Double-diamond describes the design process as divergence-converge pairs on identifying the problem and the solution.

# Design as a practice

Design thinking is a process of focusing on users' needs and wants in the design process:

1. understand what users need and want and identify the challenges
1. formulate what constitutes the core problem
1. engage in ideation to generate various potential solutions
1. develop prototypes that make potential solutions more concrete
1. test the solutions with users, to understand how they work and converge at the best solution

# Design as a practice

1. The design process in organising one’s thinking
   * Prototypes force to reformulate ones ideas and express them in a different form
1. Examining potential futures
   * Peek into the future to examine how it might be like
   * Research products and speculative design approach
1. Involving the participants in design
   * Those involved in participatory design work can ‘open up’ and discuss reasons for particular design rationales

# Review questions

1. What is an interactive system?
1. What is a prototype?
1. What benefits do interactive systems provide for experimental research?
1. How does one design an interactive system?
1. What are the three ways design could aid in social science research?
