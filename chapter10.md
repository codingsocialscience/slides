# Learning goals

- Recognise the diversity of work in the multidisciplinary venture of computational social science.
- List five different archetypes and for each, identify what kind of work is valued within it.
- Judge whether computational social science is a discipline or not.

# Defining computational social science

![width:30cm](figures/css_continuum.png)

* Is there a clear cut-off point on the continuum?
* Times are changing and new ways of studying the society, that is, doing social science, have also evolved.

---

# Reminder from Chapter 1: Ongoing changes in social sciences

1) Sample size increase
1) Analysis speed increase
1) New kinds of ways for doing research emerge
1) We can approach data with a tabula rasa
1) New kind of data sources emerge

---

# Defining computational social science

1. using computer beyond standard software tools through programming and computational thinking as a strategy to answer research questions
1. technological imagination to choose the most suitable research approach
1. social science imagination to understand what questions to ask

---

# Defining computational social science

* A discipline vs. a methodological approach?
* A need to bring together computing and the social sciences.
* Currently, scholars situate themselves to various 'archetypes' presenting different perspectives on computational social science.

---

# Archetype 1: Novel data

* Computational social science is all about collection and analysis of digital datasets, such as e-mail corpora, smartphone sensory logs, and social media data.
* Often emphasizes the size and richness of the data.
* The digital trace data are not intended for research, so various methodological and ethical concerns arise.
* Can we interpret data without theory?

---

# Archetype 2: Novel methods

* Computational social science is all about advanced and sophisticated methods.
* Focus on new practices on working with data analysis and new kinds of data, like text and images.
* The methods alone do not extract theoretical concepts, but interplay is required.
* What is the difference between quantitative and computational?

---

# Archetype 3: Models

* Computational social science is all about examining law-like interactions within and between systems.
* "To explain a phenomenon, you must be able to ‘grow’ in an artificial society."
* Studying social behaviour as if it were controlled through general mathematical laws, akin to a physical phenomenon.
* These ideas attempt to distance from traditional social science
approaches: where is its allegiance?

---

# Archetype 4: Addressing problems of digitalised society

* Computational social science is all about addressing negative ramifications of digital technologies.
* Core contribution is offering a computation-based approach to resolve a social issue – and doing this efficiently.
* Seems to focus more on aspects that computer scientists and information technology scholars find relevant.

---

# Archetype 5: Improving social science theory

* Computational social science is all about pushing social science theory forward.
* Social science theory itself is a critical contribution area, with a diverse meaning of theory.
* Social scientists can reflect social processes.
* Social scientists are good ad addressing the ‘messiness’ of real data.

---

# Working in multidisciplinary venture

* New research communities are addressing questions that have been traditionally considered the domain of social sciences.
* This requires new kind of thinking on how we do social sciences and even who do social sciences.

# Review questions

1. What is the cut-off point between quantitative and computational social sciences?
1. What similarities do the five archetypes to computational social science display?
1. What differences do the five archetypes to computational social science display?
1. Is theory important in computational social science?
