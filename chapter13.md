# Chapter 13
# Integrating computational methods into research

---

# Learning goals

- Describe the various roles that computational methods serve in the research process.
- Evaluate different operationalisations.
- Elaborate on the benefits of having guiding concepts for research activities.
- Identify the challenges present in multidisciplinary collaboration, and propose solutions for at least reducing them.
- Discuss the impacts of computational social science on scholarship.

# Research process

![width:20cm](figures/research_process.png)

* exploratory or confirmatory
* experimental, causally oriented, or descriptive
* an effort to be objective versus focused on subjectivity
* an articulation of a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method approach

---

# Research process: Computers' role

Programming can help to
* gather data
* analyse data
* interpret data

---

# Concepts and code

* Operationalisation: connecting the theoretical concept to a measurable variable.
* These examples demonstrate that computational approaches themselves do not indicate how our general tools should or should not be used in relation to specific research methods or theoretical concepts.
* It is the job of the scientists to anchor the code and its outputs in concepts and theories – the computer always runs what it is asked to run, even if the outcome has no clear conceptual relevance.

# Concepts and code

if your plans translate to shooting yourself in the foot, computational methods allow using a bazooka instead of a pellet gun.

# Theory first or theory last?

Views about the role of theory in the research process differ with one’s approach to work in computational social science.

* Deductive reasoning: the hypothesis or explicit research questions are defined, and then the data are used to answer them.
* Inductive reasoning: evidence gathered through the research is utilised for developing proposals that explain the phenomena.
* Abductive reasoning: blending deductive and inductive styles.

# Theory first or theory last?

Many ways of doing science

* Computational social science can be about translating established traditions and scholarship for computers.
* Computational social science can be about curiosity-driven enquiry with no established methods or problem formulations, thus pushing the boundaries.
* Instead of rigid operationalisation, work can focus around some conceptual insights, still giving freedom to exploration.

---

# Mixed methods or going solo

* In solo computational social science activities, the research process is rooted solely in computation and the research questions are answered only through computational methods.
* Mixed-methods approach, computational and other methods jointly.

---

# Research groups using computational social science

* Group-based research requires development of 
**trading zones** for conceptual work and active **facilitation**.
   * Trading zone a site, physical or otherwise where collaboration takes place across disciplines’ boundaries.
   * Facilitation focuses on ensuring participation and reification, producing concrete outcomes together.

# Research groups using computational social science

* There is consensus at least that excelling in our research requires both fluency in social science and skills in computational domains.
* Multidisciplinary work can produce higher impact work.
* But: do we create artificial lines by dividing teams into ‘methodological experts’ and ‘domain experts'?
* Knowledge gaps and interest gaps limit abilities to collaborate in multidisciplinary manner.

---

# Computational social science and academic institutions

* Should computational social science be in the heart of its own institute/research centre or, instead, encapsulated within established departments?
* Where does the locus of legitimate interpretation lay?
* How does computational social science impact the epistemologies of social science?
